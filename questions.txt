(a) Summarize your approach to the problem, and how your code addresses the abstractions needed
for matrix arithmetic.
I wrote three functions that take two matrices and add, multiply and subtract each other and put the result into a
new matrix. The most complicated of all of the matrix arithmetic functions was the multiplication function
I used multiple for loops to go through the matrix and select the correct element. Then once the correct element is found
the product of both is calculated and then put into a new matrix.

(b) Analyze your benchmark observations: what does the timing suggest for the time complexity of
addition, subtraction, and multiplication for two n × n matrices?
The timing  suggests that the more elements in the matrix there are then the longer it will take to perform
the different mathematical operations.

(c) What is the arithmetic time complexity of your implementation of each operation, when done on
two n × n matrices? Give tight asymptotic bounds.
The time complexity of the matrix mathematical functions is O(n*k*n).

(d) How could the code be improved in terms of usability, efficiency, and robustness?, efficiency, and robustness?
addition, subtraction, and multiplication for two n × n matrices?
The code could be improved by including templates or any of the extra credit opportunities offered in the assignment.
